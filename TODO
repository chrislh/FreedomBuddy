* TODO Make easy introduction protocol                               :design:

A self-signed message that says:

    Here is my public key ID.

    Here is a location.

Then, I can import these messages into the local keyring and the FBuddy data
store.

* TODO figure out what other request types FBuddies should request   :design:

  If they don't reply in that time, it times out and should be cleaned up.

* TODO support editing-in-place well for HTML frontend             :requests:

   I really should.  Remove + Add isn't acceptable in complex
   situations.

   let clients find:

   - all the services I host for them

    If the tests can run the system, it's complete.

  - Differentiate backends and the independent system.
