"""The Santiago service.

Santiago is designed to let users negotiate services without third party
interference.  By sending OpenPGP signed and encrypted messages over HTTPS (or
other protocols) between parties, I hope to reduce or even prevent MITM attacks.
Santiago can also use the Tor network as a proxy (with Python 2.7 or later),
allowing this negotiation to happen very quietly.

Start me with:

    $ python -i santiago.py

The first Santiago service queries another's index with a request.  That request
is handled and a request is returned.  Then, the reply is handled.  The upshot
is that we learn a new set of locations for the service.

We don't:

- Proxy requests.
- Use a reasonable data-store.
- Have a decent control (rate-limiting) mechanism.

:TODO: add doctests
:FIXME: allow multiple listeners and senders per protocol (with different
    proxies)

This dead-drop is what came of my trying to learn from bug 4185.

                                  Santiago, he
                          smiles like a Buddah, 'neath
                               his red sombrero.
