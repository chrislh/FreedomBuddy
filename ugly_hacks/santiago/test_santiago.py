"""Making Santiago dance, in 4 parts:

- Validating the initial request (playing B).
- Validating the initial response (playing A).
  - Validating the silent response.
  - Validating the rejection response.
  - Validating the acceptance response.
  - Validating the forwarded request (playing C).
- Validating the forwarded request (playing D, when C isn't the target).
- Validating the forwarded response.
  - Validating the direct response (playing A).
  - Validating the indirect response (playing C, B, and A).

FIXME: Can't use the current CPy setup.  It never returns, so I can't test
against it.

If I produce a listener that just echoes the parameters, I can validate the response:

    import httplib, urllib

    params = urllib.urlencode({'@number': 12524, '@type': 'issue', '@action': 'show'})
    headers = {"Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
               "Accept": "text/plain"}
    conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("bugs.python.org")
    print params, headers, conn

    conn.request("POST", "", params, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    print response.status, response.reason

    data = response.read()
    print data

    conn.close()
