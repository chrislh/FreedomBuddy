"""A simple Santiago service.

Start me with:

    $ python -i simple_santiago.py

This will provide you with a running Santiago service.  The important tags in
this file are:

- query
- request
- index
- handle_request
- handle_reply

They operate, essentially, in that order.  The first Santiago service queries
another's index with a request.  That request is handled and a request is
returned.  Then, the reply is handled.  The upshot is that we learn a new set of
locations for the service.

This is currently incomplete.  We don't sign, encrypt, verify, or decrypt
request messages.  I wanted to get the functional fundamentals in place first.

We also don't:

- Proxy requests.
- Use a reasonable data-store.
- Have a decent control mechanism.

FIXME: add that whole pgp thing.
FIXME: remove @cherrypy.expose from everything but index.
