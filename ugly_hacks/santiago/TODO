  replace the list of known FBuddy locations with the reply from the
  server:

  - [X] [[file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(host,%20self.reply_service,%20reply_to)][file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(host, self.reply_service, reply_to)]]

  - [X] [[file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(client,%20self.reply_service,%20reply_to)][file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(client, self.reply_service, reply_to)]]

   from one another.

  If they don't reply in that time, it times out and should be cleaned up.

* TODO move hosting and consuming back to defaultdicts              :cleanup:

  The syntax is just so much cleaner and shorter.  Implied getters and setters.
