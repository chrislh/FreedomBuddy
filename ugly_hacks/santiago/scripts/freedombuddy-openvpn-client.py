"""Automatically configure OpenVPN tunnels from a known host.

We do this by:

- Acquiring the host IP, the client IP, and the shared key from FBuddy.

- Comparing those to the existing values.

- If they've changed, update the values.

- If data's changed, restart the service.

:FIXME: add proxying.

This script assumes that the first entry in each data set is the only one we
need.  While each FBuddy key-value pair can have any number of elements, we
ignore all but the first.  The rest can be used for other exciting purposes.
