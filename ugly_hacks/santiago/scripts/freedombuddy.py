"""Prints FreedomBuddy locations to screen.

This script is designed to show where a buddy is providing a service.  It
accepts a key that identifies a trusted party and the service to show locations
for.  It can show where someone else is hosting a service for me and it can show
where I am hosting a service for a client.  It will print one location per line.

This was written to be used with a local FreedomBuddy service and it shows.
There's no way to proxy requests or send requests over anything that isn't
HTTP(S).

:TODO: allow proxies and other request methods?
:TODO: unit test the below:

If key or service isn't specified: quit.

If host == False: just pull the list of locations I host from the cache and
quit.

If query == False: skip querying the host and just pull the list of locations
they host for me from the cache and quit.

Until I implement active-request polling and between-request timeouts:

    query the host.

    wait the timeout.

    report the locations of the (now) locally known services and quit.

After I implement active-request polling:

    query the host.

    poll the list of active requests until the active request is handled or the
    timeout elapses.

    report the locations of the (now) locally known services and quit.

After I implement between-request timeouts:

    if (query == True) or (the timeout has elapsed and query != False): query
    the host.

    poll the list of active requests until the active request is handled or the
    timeout elapses.

    report the list of the (now) locally known services and quit.
