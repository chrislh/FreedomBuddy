* Issue

  There are Blammos.  They point to significant failings in the code and must be
  fixed before the code is used by others.

* Fixes [0/3]

** TODO Remove GET, use POST [0/2]

   Seriously.

*** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::#%20FIXME%20Blammo!][HTTPS Connector::78]] Only allow POST.

*** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::#%20FIXME%20Blammo!%20This%20must%20be%20a%20post.%20Use%20httplib%20right.][HTTPS Connector::126]] POST requests, don't GET them.

** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::117][HTTPS Connector::117]] Make sure HTTPS connection is secure

   I might need both a key and a cert verified correctly.  Figure out how to use
   httplib.HTTPSConnection correctly.

** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::122][HTTPS Connector::122]] Make sure connections are appropriately proxied

   I'm certain there are other proxying functions, but I don't recall them.
   Python supported proxying before version 2.7, and that's just stupid and
   broken.
