#+TITLE: httplib.HTTPSConnection Insecure
#+OPTIONS:   d:t
#+LINK_UP:  ./

* Issue

  As the Python documentation makes clear, [[http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html#httplib.HTTPSConnection][httplib.HTTPSConnection]] is insecure.
  It doesn't validate or verify the server's certificate, meaning that we can't
  guarntee the server's identity or even that we're consistently connecing to
  the same server.

* Searches

  This issue is easy to find.  There may be false positives, because it's
  possible to verify certificates around the connection itself, but the fact
  that it's there means there's something to investigate.

  #+begin_src sh
    grep -nHr "HTTPSConnection" ../src/*

  Remove or Secure Occurrences.

** TODO Secure occurrences.

   Replace [[http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html#httplib.HTTPSConnection][httplib.HTTPSConnection]] with [[https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/][httplib2]].  It checks certificates with
   httplib2 version 0.7 or later.
